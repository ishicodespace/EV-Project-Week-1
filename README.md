# EV Charging Infrastructure Analysis

## Problem Statement
"Analyze global EV charging station distribution to identify countries with poor infrastructure coverage relative to their population, guiding sustainable transportation investments."

## About
Week 1 analysis of 9,159 charging stations across 67 countries. Found Canada leads with 107.5 stations/million people, while China has near-zero coverage (0.00 stations/million). The global average is just 5.77 stations/million, revealing critical infrastructure gaps in major economies.

## Datasets
- [EV Charging Stations](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/risheepanchal/global-ev-charging-stations-dataset)
- [World Population](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset)

## Steps
- Cleaned charging station and population datasets
- Calculated stations per million people for each country  
- Identified countries needing urgent infrastructure investment
- Prepared data for machine learning models

## Results
- **Best**: Canada (107.5), Liechtenstein (101.7), Denmark (50.3)
- **Most Needed**: China (0.00), India (0.02), Indonesia (0.03)
- **Global Average**: 5.77 stations/million people
